                <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform,

                    Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,
                     unifying web application development around a
                     single programming language, rather than different
                     languages for server- and client-side scripts.

                    Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js"
